# AVR-Round_Indicator
Round-shaped indicator board based on ATMega48 ADC with tho LED scales (10 LEDs each scale)
See project [wiki](https://github.com/R1BAN/AVR-Round_Indicator/wiki/Round-indicator) for more details.


To do:
- draw a circuit diagram
- add code for supporting DS18B20 sensor (minor changes in inputs connection required, no board cutting)
